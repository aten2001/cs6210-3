set a lowthreshold and a highthreshold for unused memory for each domain.

For any domain, if the used memory is higher than the highthreshold, give some memory back to the hypervisor.

If the used memory is lower than the lowthreshold, either assign more memory from the hypervisor or from another domain that has sufficient unused memory.
