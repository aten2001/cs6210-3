At first, assign each Vcpu to Pcpu according to its ID ( assignd to #(VcpuId % numOfPcpu) of Pcpu )

using the simplest strategy to schedule the Vcpu.

Calculate the usage percentage of each Pcpu every round.

if the difference between the highest and lowest is bigger than some threshold, assgn one Vcpu running on the highest Pcpu to the lowest Pcpu.
